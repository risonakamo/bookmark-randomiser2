# other ideas
- since using a browser style, there's not much reason for the browser part to be so big. maybe try making it take up centre of screen with big side padding, and maybe even some top padding
- fuzzy search bar
    - look up fuzzy library
    - when displaying results, should show the entire path somewhere (maybe small and above text)
