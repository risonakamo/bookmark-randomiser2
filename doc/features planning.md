# main features
- session based randomising
    - user selects folder to create new session. session remembers their progress and they can return to it
    - user should be able to delete sessions
    - sessions ordered in last time user accessed and performed an action in the session
    - sessions should show this information:
        - percent progress bar of getting through the items
        - date session was created
        - last date session was modified
    - user should be able to press button to duplicate the sesssion (which also shuffles it)
        - not sure if should allow user to reset current session. for now, don't add this until seems like would be useful
    - potential to allow user to see "previous generated sets", as it may be useful to check a previously generated set for some reason
- list of recently accessed folders
    - based on the user creating sessions
    - not exactly sure if this is going to be useful with the sessions, so it can be lower priority unless it seems like users like to continuously refresh sessions
- 1 button to generate/open tabs
    - previously, too confusing to figure out which button to press. there should only be 1 button and it should be context aware to what it should do
- figure out if there is an easier way of access the page. previously it was too low incentive to try to find the bookmark randomiser button in the extension menu
    - maybe the minimum is to try a unique icon so it can be found more easily
- session create page allowing for multiple folder selections
