# Main Page
Design of main randomisation page

- should show current sessions
    - ordered by time user last performed action in the session
- button to create new session - goes to session create page

Initial prototype only needs list of sessions

Session block should contain:

- date of creation
- date of last update
- session progress
    - total number of items
    - consumed number of items
- list of items in the session
    - how can this be concated into a single string to make session easier to identify other than reading the list of items
    - otherwise, with list of items, can be difficult to tell 2 sessions are copies of each other
- delete session button
- duplicate session button (resets progress)
